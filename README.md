# DreamDecoder
DreamDecoder is a prototype NLP project that collects dream descriptions, preprocesses text, and applies clustering to group similar dreams. While current functionality stops at clustering, future plans include mapping clusters to semantic labels and linking them to psychological states for automated dream interpretation.
